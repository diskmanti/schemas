  "description": "EgressNetworkPolicy describes the current egress network policy for a Namespace. When using the 'redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant' network plugin, traffic from a pod to an IP address outside the cluster will be checked against each EgressNetworkPolicyRule in the pod's namespace's EgressNetworkPolicy, in order. If no rule matches (or no EgressNetworkPolicy is present) then the traffic will be allowed by default.\n\nCompatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).",
