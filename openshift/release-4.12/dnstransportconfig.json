      "description": "transport allows cluster administrators to opt-in to using a DNS-over-TLS connection between cluster DNS and an upstream resolver(s). Configuring TLS as the transport at this level without configuring a CABundle will result in the system certificates being used to verify the serving certificate of the upstream resolver(s).\n\nPossible values: \"\" (empty) - This means no explicit choice has been made and the platform chooses the default which is subject to change over time. The current default is \"Cleartext\". \"Cleartext\" - Cluster admin specified cleartext option. This results in the same functionality as an empty value but may be useful when a cluster admin wants to be more explicit about the transport, or wants to switch from \"TLS\" to \"Cleartext\" explicitly. \"TLS\" - This indicates that DNS queries should be sent over a TLS connection. If Transport is set to TLS, you MUST also set ServerName. If a port is not included with the upstream IP, port 853 will be tried by default per RFC 7858 section 3.1; https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7858#section-3.1.",
