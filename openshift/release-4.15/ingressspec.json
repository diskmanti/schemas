Otherwise, the route is rejected. - The first match, by domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, in the ordering of the RequiredHSTSPolicies determines the route's admission status. - If the candidate route doesn't match any requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, then it may use any HSTS Policy annotation.\n\nThe HSTS policy configuration may be changed after routes have already been created. An update to a previously admitted route may then fail if the updated route does not conform to the updated HSTS policy configuration.
