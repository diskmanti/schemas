  "description": "EgressRouter is a feature allowing the user to define an egress router that acts as a bridge between pods and external systems. The egress router runs a service that redirects egress traffic originating from a pod or a group of pods to a remote external system or multiple destinations as per configuration.\n\nIt is consumed by the cluster-network-operator. More specifically, given an EgressRouter CR with <name>, the CNO will create and manage: - A service called <name> - An egress pod called <name> - A NAD called <name>\n\nCompatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).\n\nEgressRouter is a single egressrouter pod configuration object.",
