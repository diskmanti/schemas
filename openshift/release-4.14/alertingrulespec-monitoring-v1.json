      "description": "groups is a list of grouped alerting rules.  Rule groups are the unit at which Prometheus parallelizes rule processing.  All rules in a single group share a configured evaluation interval.  All rules in the group will be processed together on this interval, sequentially, and all rules will be processed.\n\nIt's common to group related alerting rules into a single AlertingRule resources, and within that resource, closely related alerts, or simply alerts with the same interval, into individual groups.  You are also free to create AlertingRule resources with only a single rule group, but be aware that this can have a performance impact on Prometheus if the group is extremely large or has very complex query expressions to evaluate. Spreading very complex rules across multiple groups to allow them to be processed in parallel is also a common use-case.",
