Values that are fractions of a second are rounded down to the nearest second. If the configured value is less than 1s, the default value will be used. If not configured, the value will be 0s and OpenShift will use a default value of 30 seconds unless noted otherwise in the respective Corefile for your version of OpenShift. The default value of 30 seconds is subject to change.",
