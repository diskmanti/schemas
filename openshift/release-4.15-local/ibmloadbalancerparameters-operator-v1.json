See \"service.kubernetes.io/ibm-load-balancer-cloud-provider-enable-features: \"proxy-protocol\"\" at https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-lbaas\"\n\nPROXY protocol can be used with load balancers that support it to communicate the source addresses of client connections when forwarding those connections to the IngressController.  Using PROXY protocol enables the IngressController to report those source addresses instead of reporting the load balancer's address in HTTP headers and logs.  Note that enabling PROXY protocol on the IngressController will cause connections to fail if you are not using a load balancer that uses PROXY protocol to forward connections to the IngressController.  See http://www.haproxy.org/download/2.2/doc/proxy-protocol.txt for information about PROXY protocol.\n\nValid values for protocol are TCP, PROXY and omitted. When omitted, this means no opinion and the platform is left to choose a reasonable default, which is subject to change over time. The current default is TCP, without the proxy protocol enabled.",
