The validator is responsible for reading the certificate bundle from the required key \"ca-bundle.crt\", merging it with the system default trust bundle, and writing the merged trust bundle to a ConfigMap named \"trusted-ca-bundle\" in the \"openshift-config-managed\" namespace. Clients that expect to make proxy connections must use the trusted-ca-bundle for all HTTPS requests to the proxy, and may use the trusted-ca-bundle for non-proxy HTTPS requests as well.\n\nThe namespace for the ConfigMap referenced by trustedCA is \"openshift-config\". Here is an example ConfigMap (in yaml):\n\napiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata:\n name: user-ca-bundle\n namespace: openshift-config\n data:\n   ca-bundle.crt: |\n     -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n     Custom CA certificate bundle.\n     -----END CERTIFICATE-----",
